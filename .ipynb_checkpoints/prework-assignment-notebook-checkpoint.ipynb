    "- Science, as a discipline, relies heavily on reproducibility and replicability. If results of scientific studies are difficult or impossible to replicate, a replication crisis (similar to the one plaguing social sciences like psychology in recent times) would occur. \n",
    "- Due to questionable research practices (such as partial publication of data and p-value rounding) and even outright fraud (such as falsification of data), there has been some issues with reproducing certain findings that have been published in scientific publications. This problem is further exacerbated by the fact that scientists often do not publish their entire methodology detailing their every step. The scientist who published a finding, himself, may also face issues with replication, if the methodology was not taken note of, or if datasets were mixed up. \n",
    "- Version control can help address this problem both on an individual level, and a much broader macro level. \n",
    "- On the individual level, version control can help scientists keep track of various research artifacts, such as datasets, documents and manuscripts. It can help maintain different versions of the same artefact and merge changes to ensure that all research artefacts are kept in order. This helps them improve their productivity.\n",
    "- On a macro level, version control can help make science more open, as every single stage of a research finding is uploaded. This ensures that others who wish to replicate a particular finding, have the resources and information required to do so. It also ensures that those who wish to build on existing findings have the additional information and methodology to do so. "
